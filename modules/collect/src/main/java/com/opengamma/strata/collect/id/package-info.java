 * Identifier and link data structures.
 * <p>
 * This package provides a standard identifier and link mechanism.
 * <p>
 * The identifier is used to uniquely identify domain objects.
 * Each identifier consists of two parts, a scheme and a value that is unique within that scheme.
 * <p>
 * The link is used to connect two identified domain objects together.
 * This provides loose coupling between different parts of the object model.
